# Remote-Contol-Over-Mail
Server to contol computer using POP3 and SMTP protocols

Using OpenPop library to download mails from server


#How to use:
Create new Console Application with 2.0 NET framework
Open project properties and change Output type to Windows Application (to make terminal window invisible),
Download OpenPop from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/hpop/
Add OpenPop.dll as reference to your project
Then download source from SourceWithNoLocalOutput and paste it to your project
Read and study the code and change parameters to your data
Select Release mode and click Build -> Build RCM

Now go to project file under bin/release and copy RCM.exe and OpenPop.dll to new file
This file is everything you need to run this application.

For debuging I suggest you to use Source.cs undet Console Application, because of nice local output.
